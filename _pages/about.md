Postdoctoral research fellow at the Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS), working on developing novel machine learning methods to understand the rules of colonization of the gut microbiome. 

During my graduate career I developed multi-physics, multi-scaled models to study the effects of fluid dynamics on microbial evolution. I also collaborated with biomechanical engineers to explore the effects of circulatory flow on aging in tissues. I enjoy cross-disciplinary research and strongly value lifelong learning. I believe the best research is done with the collaboration of experts from diverse backgrounds.
