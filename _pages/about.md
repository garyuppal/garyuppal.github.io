Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in (Georg Gerber's)[https://gerber.bwh.harvard.edu/] lab at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. My work focuses on developing novel machine learning methods to explore the microbiome's impact on human disease, as well as microbial interactions and colonization dynamics within the gut microbiome. 

I work in close collaboration with wet lab scientists to aid in experimental design and support model development and refinement. I aim to develop innovative solutions grounded in relevant biological questions, advancing the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease.

I received my PhD in Physics under the supervision of (Dervis Can Vural)[https://www3.nd.edu/~dvural/], where I developed multi-physics, multi-scaled models to study the effects of fluid dynamics on microbial evolution. I also collaborated with biomechanical engineers to explore the effects of circulatory flow on aging in mammalian tissues.
